# ACM ML Workshop — Home

Welcome to the ACM Machine Learning Workshop! This workshop is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of machine learning, with a focus on practical applications and hands-on exercises. Each day builds on the previous one, covering key concepts and techniques.

## Workshop Goals
- Understand the machine learning pipeline from data preparation to deployment.
- Learn and implement key ML algorithms and techniques.
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets and tools.

## Schedule Overview

- **Day 1: Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**
  - Learn the importance of data cleaning and how to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats.
  - Perform feature engineering to create meaningful variables like price per square foot.
  - Prepare data for machine learning by encoding categories and removing irrelevant features.

- **Day 2: Model Training and Analysis**
  - Explore the fundamentals of supervised learning, including regression and classification problems.
  - Learn about overfitting, underfitting, and the importance of train-test splits.
  - Implement and evaluate models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.

- **Day 3: Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
  - Understand the basics of NLP and its applications.
  - Learn about word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText.
  - Explore RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformer models like BERT and GPT.
  - Implement next-word prediction using a pre-trained GPT model.

- **Day 4: Intro to Deep Learning & Deployment Basics**
  - Understand the basics of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  - Learn about famous CNN architectures like LeNet, AlexNet, and ResNet.
  - Get an introduction to hosting models on platforms like Hugging Face.

## Resources & Next Steps
- Recommended reading and tutorials will be shared during the sessions.
- After the workshop, try applying what you've learned to a small end-to-end project.
- Questions? Feel free to ask during the sessions or reach out via the repository.

We hope you enjoy the workshop and gain valuable insights into the world of machine learning!
